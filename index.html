        <p class="text">ChurchX is a for profit software company looking to ignite a culture of activism in movements
            that are traditional in nature.
            With the use of blockchain technology and decentralized systems, ChurchX enables churches and disciples to
            source, acquire and maintain
            physical and digital property to ultimately become a cohesive, independent, diplomatically recognised <a

            </p>
        <br>
        <H2 class="header2">Churches & disciples</H2>
        <p>
            There are two main actors that make up ChurchX: churches and disciples. 
            
        <br>
        <br>
            ChurchX disciples are simply individuals looking to teach and spread 
            the Word of God.
            These are activists that have the ability to affect the world around them for the better. These are people that know that they were put here to 
            fight for God.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second actor is the church itself. ChurchX is made up of churches around the globe. These are physical or digital groups of Christians that want to become
            more than a sunday gathering. With the use of the tools provided by ChurchX, these churches will be the foundation of our organization.
            <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <H2 class="header2">Mission</H2>
        <p>
            ChurchX aims to accelerate the spiritual impact of modern churches by enabling them to organize and acquire physical and digital property for the benefit of 
            its members.  
            By increasing the church's economic footprint, we allow the church to play a more effective role in our increasingly anti-religious society.
            This means empowering individuals to spread the Word and grow the Christian movement beyond any geographic border.
